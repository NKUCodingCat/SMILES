# SMILES parser

## Purpose

A SMILES code validator (for now) and (in the near future) a parser to create
bond matrices, connectivity matrices, and (later) generate xyz files for use
with GAMESS or other quantum chemistry programs

## Principles

From the grammar definition of SMILES in EBNF a parser using 
pyparsing was generated. For what SMILES is see 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system)
For pyparsing: http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/
